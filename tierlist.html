                <section>
                    <img src="img/tierlist.png" alt="">
                    <p>This tierlist rates all the slimes currently in the game based on how useful they are in battle and if they are worth putting time into.</p>

                    <h2>S Tier</h2>
                    <p>The best slime(s) in the game and highly recommended. Great damage output and amazing synergy with companions, relics and treasures. They are also the best options for events, dungeons and bosses. If you have one of these slimes, we encourage you to use them.</p>

                    <h2>A Tier</h2>
                    <p>Not the best slime(s) but great secondary options if you don't have the best ones. Good damage output and great synergy with companions, relics and treasures. You can stick around with these slimes even after acquiring a S Tier slime. When it comes to Slime Legion, these slimes are the best support to have.</p>

                    <h2>B Tier</h2>
                    <p>Solid options if you are missing the A Tier or S Tier slimes. Even though they aren't as good, they can still achieve great things and are still worth looking into. These slimes also make great support for Slime Legion and are highly recommended to use alongside A Tier slimes.</p>

                    <h2>C Tier</h2>
                    <p>Not as great as B Tier but still gets the job done. We recommend using these slimes as support in Slime Legion because of their supportive capabilities rather than maining them.</p>

                    <h2>D Tier</h2>
                    <p>Gets the job done but are easily replaceable by better ones. We recommend using these slimes as support if you dont have enough C tier slimes.</p>

                    <h2>E Tier</h2>
                    <p>Bad but useable enough to not be the worst. Not worth it to build but is an okay option as support in Slime Legion.</p>

                    <h2>F Tier</h2>
                    <p>Very bad don't use these slimes, not even temporarily. Just use Aku instead. These slimes are not worth the effort to build nor to have as (temporary) support in Slime Legion.</p>
